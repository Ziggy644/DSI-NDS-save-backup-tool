******** DSI HBC save tool ********

Controls: A: Dump EEPROM savedata, X: Write EEPROM from file, START: exit

DUMP EEPROM:
The dumped data will be written in "savedata.bin" in the same directory as the .nds file.
If the eeprom is encrypted, it will not work.
For usage with flashcard/CFW: just rename "savedata.bin" to "<nds rom game>.sav" and use it with the same game.

WRITE EEPROM:
Put the savedata.bin file in the same directory as the .nds file. Then launch the tool and press X.
The savedata.bin will then be written to the EEPROM chip.
